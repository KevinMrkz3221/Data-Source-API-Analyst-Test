# Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test
"Homework assignment for Data Source API Analyst role."

This project is a solution to the technical assessment exercise. I used the GitHub API to extract information from public repositories, commits, and content. Testing was done with Google Colab and Postman.

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (requests)
- Postman

## Reflection
This challenge helped me strengthen my skills in documentation, endpoint analysis, and error handling with real APIs. I especially enjoyed the integration with Colab for its flexibility.
